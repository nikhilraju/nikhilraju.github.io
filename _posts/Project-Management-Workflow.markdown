## Why use Clubhouse?

As a developer,  it might seem like unnecessary overhead initally. 

But the investment starts paying off quickly when you need to interact with more people - e.g your team mates, the product owner for a project, tech manager, maintainer groups etc.


* It can help centralize communication about a task and its dependencies - any related logs, dependencies, status updates 

* The dashboard can help you keep your work day and priorities organized

* Will make weekly planning meetings more efficient
